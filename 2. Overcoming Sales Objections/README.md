## Background information

We all experience objections every day. Whether it is discussing budgets during a team meeting at work, a discussion with our family about dinner options, trying to decide which movie to watch on movie night, or a hundred other situations in life, we all must handle objections to our preferences, choices, and desired outcomes. The sales process is so often driven by a prospect’s objections that practicing and developing your skill in objections handling is critical to your success. A great salesperson learns and applies sales best practices and insights from human psychology to help them develop their skills.

What is objection handling? This is a part of the sales process when the prospect raises one or more objections or concerns about the product, the price, or some aspect of the sale, and you must respond to those objections to overcome them and close the sale. Sometimes the objections are based on misunderstanding or lack of understanding about details of the product, its promotion, its competitors, or its customers, and you can educate them about those facts. Sometimes the objections are really a starting point for negotiating price or delivery terms or promotion incentives, and you can negotiate on those terms. Sometimes the objections are really a cover for the prospect feeling overwhelmed, understaffed, or out of time, and you can consider where you can bring resources to bear to help that prospect with those feelings. This is the time to be innovative, creative and be seen by the prospect as a collaborative partner in their success. Responding to objections is your time to shine!

Over many decades of experience in “direct” selling, some key practices and techniques have been identified. They include:

1. **Use active listening skills (Confirm)**. Slow down, ask open-ended questions, and try to really understand what they mean. You want to understand more than just the words they are saying. You want to understand the intent and emotion behind the words too.
2. **Clarify with questions**. Explore the issues and topics raised, and be curious. That helps the prospect feel heard, and including them in the solution development process also helps them feel ownership of the solution.
3. **Repeat back what you heard (Catch)**. Make sure the other person understands that you heard them and that you understand their objection.
4. **Validate the prospect’s concerns**. As you repeat back what you heard, validate their perspective. Their emotions and intent are real, even if the facts they raise are not, or are not as important as they think they are.
5. **Ask permission to overcome the problem**. Actively seek to bring down barriers to solving the concern and gain buy-in to doing so.
6. **Reframe their objections (Contain)**. Restate their concern in ways that make it more actionable, more solvable, or more in perspective and in context with other information that make it seem less daunting.
7. **Leverage social proof (Commit)**. As you respond to their objections, provide stories or data about other customers who face the same issue and what worked for them.
8. **Close the deal (Convince)**. Negotiate the specifics of the solution that overcomes their objections and meets their needs.

There are many resources on the Internet covering sales techniques in general and overcoming objections specifically. The techniques that collectively are referred to as “active listening” are perhaps the most important to a collaborative, partnership-based direct selling process. See the links in Additional Resources below for a few quick reads to get you started, but you will find much more online if you want to read further.

## Tasks

Your account data analysis showed that one of your accounts, Bar 7, owned by Lorena Posacco, had robust sales of Red Bull products a few years ago, but in the last three years, Bar 7’s sales have dropped dramatically. You also learned from your data analysis that Bar 7 does not have many marketing and promotion programs implemented, nor a wide product assortment. You have recently been given account management responsibility for the Bar 7 account, and you met with Lorena to introduce yourself and start a dialog about Red Bull sales in her bar.

During that initial meeting, you practiced active listening and made notes about Lorena’s concerns and objections. She had two principal concerns:

“Red Bull is quite expensive compared to other energy drinks.”
“Customers don’t ask for Red Bull in my bar.”
Your task is to write, record, and submit a short video message giving a response to the objections raised by Lorena. Think of it as if you were leaving a voicemail for Lorena, following up after your initial meeting and proposing a second meeting. Provide your thoughts in response to what you learned in the first meeting, and give Lorena something to think about as a lead-in to your second meeting. Keep your video short, like a typical voicemail; there is no need to record more than a few minutes. Make your message personal between yourself and Lorena; remember you are trying to build a long-term partnership relationship with her. Be sure to utilize any of the best practices in the Background Information section above as appropriate, and of course, let your winning personality and collaborative, pro-active problem-solving approach shine through!

When crafting your video message, your possible responses to Lorena’s objections could include ideas such as:

- Your margins could be higher than competing products
- Your bar’s image is influenced by the quality of the products you feature
- Our experience with other customers is that when Red Bull is prominently featured, it gets considerable uplift compared to competing products
- Energy drinks are one of the fastest-growing product categories and point of sale promotion works very well

But don’t limit yourself to those; see the reading in Additional Resources for more ideas and come up with your own!

You should also anticipate that Lorena will disagree with one or more of your responses to her objections. This is a good opportunity to validate her concerns, reframe, and suggest alternative paths forward that might better meet her real needs.
