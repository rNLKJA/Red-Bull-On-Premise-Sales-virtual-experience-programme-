## Background information

One of the key skills you will need to succeed as a Red Bull On-Premise Specialist is the ability to make sense of sales and operational data and communicate your understanding of that data to others:

- Which are your highest performing accounts?
- Which are lagging behind and need more support and attention?
- Which marketing, promotion, and merchandising initiatives work best in which accounts and account types?
- What are the best time windows for visiting an account? For making deliveries to that account?
- Which accounts do not have the optimal product SKU availability for a given event or time period?

Robust business and operational decisions require robust data and analysis, and those analyses must be shareable and easily collaborated upon. You will often need to draw insights from large sales and account datasets. Your skills with Excel or other spreadsheet tools will regularly be put to the test!

If you are already an Excel expert, the task below will let you demonstrate your expertise with what will feel like a routine data analysis. However, if you are not already familiar and comfortable with analyzing and graphing data in Excel and making charts to share with others, now is the time to practice. To help you get started, there are some links in the Additional Resources section below that will give you a quick introduction to graphing data in Excel and calculating the growth rate of a series of numbers. You will find many free resources on the web, including on YouTube, if you would like to watch the process being done.

Once you have done your data analysis and prepared graphs of key trends and comparisons, you may need to communicate your findings to others on your team or even to your accounts. One way to do so is to create a PowerPoint presentation. Your graphs will appear on slides with accompanying text about the meaning of the chart, the key findings you want to communicate, and any other relevant information about the data.

Your ability to successfully communicate about the data and to convince your team of your recommendations depends on the clarity and impact of your communications. Your presentation should make it easy for your audience to understand the most important aspects of the data. Often, you will be the only one who has spent the time needed to be fully immersed in the data; your audience is depending on you to extract the most important data and findings for them. So make your presentation simple, concise, and direct. Tell your audience what the data set is, what it says, and what it means for whatever sales or operational decision must be made relative to it. You want your audience to have confidence in your analysis and your conclusions, so be transparent about any problems, quality issues, or errors in the data, and how those may have affected your analysis. Then the discussion will naturally focus on what decision to make supported by the data, rather than on your analysis of it.

## Tasks

Your task is to analyze the sales data contained in the Excel spreadsheet in Additional Resources below, and then write a short PowerPoint presentation to communicate your observations and key findings of that data with the appropriate charts and tables of the data, using the template also found in Additional Resources.

First, open the spreadsheet and familiarize yourself with the data. Normally, this kind of data would be highly confidential, but there is no need to worry about that for this exercise; the data in the spreadsheet is randomly generated and isnâ€™t real. Assuming for the sake of this task that the data is representative of actual sales account data, what kind of data is there? What information do the columns contain? What kind of trends could you see if you graphed that data in various ways? What kinds of observations are relevant to understanding sales trends and opportunities? What data seems to correlate with sales volume, and what data seems not to correlate? How would you need to sort or slice the data differently in order to see those correlations?

Then, begin your formal analysis of the data. For this task, you are going to need to compute the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for sales volume for the 5 year period in the spreadsheet so you can compare sales growth across your accounts. So you will need to add a formula to the spreadsheet and sort the spreadsheet so that you can see the data sorted by CAGR and account type. See the link in Additional Resources for how to implement a CAGR calculation in Excel. You may also want to add calculations to add up total sales by account, account type, and/or year. Decide what trends and findings you think make sense to graph or pull out from the data. For example, your analysis could include:

- Total sales by Account Type and Year
- Sales growth/trends by Account Type
- Sales growth/trends by Year
- Best and worst performing accounts (overall, and by account type)
- Effect of assortment (product lines) presence on sales
- Effectiveness of the different marketing/promotion programs

You may consider other ways to analyze the data as you think make sense as well. To keep this exercise simple, no pricing data is included in the spreadsheet, only quantities. So you will be analyzing trends in quantities sold, not revenue sold. Just use the quantity sold data for your comparisons and trend analysis.

As you analyze the data, look for trends, outliers, potential strengths, and potential weaknesses. What does your analysis tell you is happening to sales of Red Bull products that might suggest opportunities or needed actions in particular accounts, or overall? Which marketing and promotion programs seem to be correlated with positive sales growth in which account types? What do the product line availability data tell you, if anything?

Once you have analyzed the data, use the PowerPoint presentation template in Additional Resources as a starting point to communicate your findings. Add in your chosen charts from Excel, fill in tables as appropriate, and then write your observations and key findings of the data in bullet point format. Feel free to modify the template and add or remove slides as needed to fit your chosen data analysis. But remember, your job is to make the data easily understandable, with observations communicated directly and concisely. Make sure you title your charts with specific descriptions of the data in the chart, and title the slides with a summary of what the chart or table shows.
